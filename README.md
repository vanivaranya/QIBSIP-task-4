EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

We've all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.
In this Project, I used Python to build an email spam detector. Then, I used machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.

I performed EDA on dataset and trained models- Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, Complement Naive Bayes and Decision Tree on the dataset, Logistic Regression model giving highest accuracy of 97.76 %.
